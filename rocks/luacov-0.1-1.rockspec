      LuaCov is a simple coverage analysis tool for Lua scripts.
      When a Lua script is run with the luacov module, it
      generates a stats file. The luacov command-line script then
      processes this file generating a report indicating which code
      paths were not traversed, which is useful for verifying the
      effectiveness of a test suite.
