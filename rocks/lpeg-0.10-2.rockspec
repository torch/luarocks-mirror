      LPeg is a new pattern-matching library for Lua, based on Parsing
      Expression Grammars (PEGs). The nice thing about PEGs is that it
      has a formal basis (instead of being an ad-hoc set of features),
      allows an efficient and simple implementation, and does most things
      we expect from a pattern-matching library (and more, as we can
      define entire grammars).
